Day 37 of 100

So far I've been using the get method but today I learned the put, post, and delete methods. These all fall under the requests module and allows me to do more.

For instance, update a pixel graph that can represent anything a user wants. The measurement can be distance, the time elapsed, or even just reps for when you're getting your swole on.

Each pixel's color intensity depends on the average so at first, it may vary greatly, but after a while, you'll plainly see that dark colors have high measurements and light colors have low measurements (like here on Git). Also, if I must, I can backlog activity if a day or days are 'missed'.
